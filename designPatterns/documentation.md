# Design Patterns Documentation

## Objective

The purpose of this documentation is to understand the importance of design patterns, why they are important, and all essential information about them.

## What is a Design Pattern?

A Design Pattern (DP) describes:
- A problem that occurs very frequently in an environment
- The architecture of the solution to this problem, usable thousands of times
- Recurring types of solutions to common problems in various situations

## Benefits of Design Patterns

Design Patterns offer:
- Documentation of proven design experience
- Identification and specification of high-level abstractions
- A common vocabulary for understanding design principles
- Assistance in building complex and heterogeneous software

## Categories of Design Patterns

### 1. Creation
- **Description**: How objects are created, initialized, and configured
- **Key Aspect**: Isolation of creation and initialization code
- **Examples**: Singleton, Prototype, Builder, Abstract Factory

### 2. Structure
- **Description**: How objects should be connected for future-proof design
- **Examples**: Adapter, Composite, Bridge, Decorator, Facade, Proxy

### 3. Behavior
- **Description**: Interaction behaviors between objects
- **Key Aspect**: Management of dynamic interactions
- **Examples**: Strategy, Observer, Iterator, Mediator, Visitor, State

## Scope of Design Patterns

| Scope | Focus | Basis |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Class | Relationships between classes and subclasses | Inheritance |
| Instance (Object) | Relationships between objects | Composition |
